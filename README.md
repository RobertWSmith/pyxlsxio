# Python wrapper for the XLSX I/O - C library for reading and writing .xslx files #

Very early in the wrapper process, still writing tests but small examples seem to be working on the Reader side. The Writer object is implemented but not tested yet.

This library seeks to wrap the [XLSX I/O](https://github.com/brechtsanders/xlsxio) C library for reading and writing .xslx files and to provide a Python API for accessing this library.
